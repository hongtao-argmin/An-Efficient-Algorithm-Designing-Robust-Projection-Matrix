An Efficient Algorithm for Designing Projection Matrix in Compressive Sensing Based on Alternating Optimization

We publish our code for the main algorithm shown in the paper ''An Efficient Algorithm for Designing Projection Matrix in Compressive Sensing Based on Alternating Optimization''. 

In order to run this function, you have to download the Software minFunc through https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html.

The method proposed in this function is a little different from the procedures shown in the original paper. However, they solve the same problem and we claim that they work almost similar. If you find anh bugs in it, feel free to contact me through hongtao@cs.technion.ac.il.

A novel technique to address the similar problems mentioned in this paper is given in the following paper:
"An efficient method for robust projection matrix design" and you can find the code in this paper via https://github.com/happyhongt/An-efficient-method-for-robust-projection-matrix-design/blob/master/README.md.
